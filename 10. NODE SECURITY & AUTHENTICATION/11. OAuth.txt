# OAuth 2.0 — Overview Notes

## What is OAuth?
**OAuth (Open Authorization)** is an authentication and authorization standard used by major platforms like **Google**, **Facebook**, and **GitHub** to enable secure sign-ins and data sharing between applications.

It powers **Social Sign-On** — allowing users to log into an app (like Medium) using credentials from another trusted provider (like Google).

## Why OAuth Exists
Traditional login systems require users to enter passwords directly into each app — risky for security.  
OAuth fixes this by letting users authenticate **through trusted providers** without giving their password to every app.

Example:
- You choose *“Sign in with Google”* on Medium.
- You are redirected to **Google’s domain** (accounts.google.com).
- You enter your password **only on Google’s page**.
- Google verifies you, then returns a **token** to Medium.

✅ Medium never sees your Google password.  
✅ The token confirms you’re authenticated.  
✅ Medium can now access allowed data (like name, email).

## How It Works — Simplified Flow
1. **User clicks “Sign in with Google.”**  
2. App redirects to **Google’s OAuth server.**  
3. User logs in and gives consent (what info to share).  
4. Google sends an **access token** to the app.  
5. App uses the token to access allowed data (API calls).

## Benefits of OAuth
- **Security:** Passwords are entered only on trusted domains.  
- **Centralization:** One secure authentication server (e.g., Google) for all apps.  
- **User Control:** Users can revoke access anytime.  
- **Reduced Attack Surface:** Only one heavily secured server handles authentication.  
- **Convenience:** One login works across multiple services.

---

## Real Example — Medium & Google
- When signing into **Medium** with Google, you’re redirected to Google’s OAuth server.  
- Google authenticates you and issues Medium a token.  
- You can later revoke Medium’s access from your Google Account → Security → “Apps with access.”  
- Once revoked, Medium can’t access your Google data until you reauthorize it.

---

## Key Terms
- **OAuth Server (Authorization Server):** Handles user authentication (e.g., Google).  
- **Client Application:** The app requesting access (e.g., Medium).  
- **Access Token:** A credential given to the app to access allowed data.  
- **Consent Screen:** Where the user approves sharing info.

## Summary
OAuth enables secure, simple, and centralized login across the web.  
It improves both **user experience** and **security** by:
- Avoiding password sharing.
- Minimizing login fatigue.
- Providing easy account revocation and control.
