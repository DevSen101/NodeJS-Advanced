# Social Sign-On (Social Login) — Summary Notes

## What is Social Sign-On?
Social Sign-On (SSO) allows users to log into a website using existing accounts from platforms like **Google**, **Facebook**, **GitHub**, etc., instead of creating new credentials for every site.

---

## Example: Medium.com
- Medium provides login options using Google, Facebook, and other providers.
- Users can sign up with Google credentials instead of creating a new Medium username and password.
- Once logged into Google, users can access Medium instantly — often in just one or two clicks.

---

## Key Advantages
1. **Convenience** — Users don’t have to remember new passwords.
2. **Speed** — Sign-up and sign-in become almost instant.
3. **Consistency** — Profile data (like name and email) can auto-fill from social accounts.

---

## Developer Perspective
- The app (like Medium) still tracks users internally but offloads authentication to trusted providers.
- Developers save effort — no need to:
  - Implement password creation/reset systems.
  - Manage password storage or encryption.
- The responsibility of account security is handled by large, experienced providers like Google.

---

## Security Benefits
- Tech giants like Google and Facebook invest millions in security.
- They maintain advanced protection against breaches, saving smaller teams from complex authentication challenges.
- Using their OAuth-based authentication reduces the risk of mishandling passwords.

---

## Summary
Social Sign-On improves user experience and security by:
- Simplifying the login process.
- Reducing password fatigue.
- Delegating authentication and password management to secure, trusted providers.
