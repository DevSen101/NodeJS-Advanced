Here’s a **concise summary** (like quick notes) of the transcript you shared — explaining **cookies, authentication, and sessions** in simple, developer-friendly language 👇

### 🍪 **What Are Cookies**

* **Cookies = small data strings stored in the browser** (usually set by the server).
* Stored per **domain** and sometimes per **path**.
* You can view them in Chrome DevTools → **Application → Cookies**.
* Used mainly for **tracking**, **sessions**, and **authentication**.
* Automatically sent by the browser to the server on every request to that domain.

---

### ⚙️ **Cookie Properties**

* **`expires` / `max-age`** → defines how long the cookie lives.
* **`secure`** → cookie sent **only over HTTPS**.
* **`httpOnly`** → not accessible via JavaScript → prevents **XSS attacks**.
* **`sameSite`** → limits cross-site requests (helps prevent **CSRF attacks**).

---

### 🔒 **Why `httpOnly` & `secure` Matter**

* Protect cookies from malicious JS (Cross-Site Scripting).
* Prevent attackers from stealing authentication data.
* Example: If an attacker injects JS on a trusted site, `httpOnly` cookies cannot be read by that JS.

---

### 🔑 **Cookies vs Token-Based Authentication**

#### 1️⃣ **Token-based (JWT)**

* Server verifies credentials → returns **access token (JWT)**.
* Browser stores token (localStorage or memory).
* Each request must include token manually in the **Authorization header**.

  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <token>
  ```
* Developer must handle sending token manually.

#### 2️⃣ **Cookie-based**

* Server verifies credentials → returns **Set-Cookie** header in response.
  Browser automatically stores cookie.
* For every subsequent request → browser **automatically attaches** that cookie:

  ```
  Cookie: session_id=abc123
  ```
* Server identifies the user from that cookie’s value (e.g., session ID or access token).

---

### 💡 **Key Idea**

* Both cookies and tokens are ways to **prove user identity** to the server.
* Cookies are **automatically handled by browsers**, while tokens are **manually managed by code**.
* Cookies often used with **sessions**, JWTs often used in **stateless APIs**.
