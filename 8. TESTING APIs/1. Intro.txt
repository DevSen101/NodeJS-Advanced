ðŸ“˜ NOTES: API Testing in Node.js

1. Manual Testing (Before Automation)
   - Weâ€™ve been manually restarting the server and testing endpoints via Postman or frontend.
   - This helps us understand how things work, but itâ€™s not scalable for large or complex projects.

2. Need for Automated API Testing
   - As the project grows, manual testing becomes time-consuming and prone to human error.
   - Automated tests ensure all endpoints work as expected, even after code changes.

3. Testing Pyramid
   - At the base: Unit Tests (test individual functions/modules)
   - In the middle: API Tests (test integration between backend components)
   - At the top: UI Tests (simulate user interactions through the frontend)
   - The user is at the very top â€” real-world interaction.

4. Difference Between Test Types
   - **Unit Tests:** Check small, isolated pieces of code.  
     Example: A function that adds 5 + 5 = 10.
   - **API (Integration) Tests:** Check how multiple components work together through endpoints.
   - **End-to-End (UI) Tests:** Simulate real user behavior on the frontend, triggering backend APIs.

5. Focus: API (Integration) Testing
   - API tests verify that:
     - Requests reach the server properly.
     - Middleware functions work as intended.
     - Request handlers process data correctly.
     - The correct response is returned.
   - These tests ensure all backend parts integrate and respond properly as one complete API.

6. Importance of API Tests
   - They act as a bridge between unit and end-to-end tests.
   - Help detect issues early at the API layer.
   - Ensure reliability of endpoints when integrated with the frontend or mobile app.

7. Summary
   - Unit tests = test functions in isolation.
   - API tests = test endpoints and middleware together.
   - UI tests = test the whole app flow from the userâ€™s view.
   - For Node.js servers, API testing is crucial to maintain stable and predictable backend behavior.
