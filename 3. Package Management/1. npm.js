// **NPM (Node Package Manager) Notes**

// ---

// ### Introduction

// When we build advanced applications in Node.js, the built-in tools are sometimes not enough. To make development easier and faster, developers use additional code created by others called *packages* or *modules*. These packages help in performing common tasks like making HTTP requests, creating servers, or connecting with databases.

// ---

// ### What are Packages

// * Packages are reusable bundles of code.
// * They are created by other developers and shared publicly.
// * They allow us to add new functionality without writing everything from scratch.

// ---

// ### NPM Overview

// * **NPM** stands for **Node Package Manager**.
// * It has two meanings:

//   1. **npmjs.com** – A website that hosts millions of packages.
//   2. **npm CLI (Command Line Interface)** – A tool that comes with Node.js installation.

// ---

// ### Role of NPM

// * Helps install, manage, and share Node.js packages.
// * Central place for open-source code.
// * Makes it easier to find and use third-party libraries.
// * Encourages collaboration among developers.

// ---

// ### NPM CLI (Command Line Tool)

// * Installed automatically with Node.js.
// * Used to run commands related to packages.
// * Common commands:

//   * `npm init` – Initialize a new Node.js project.
//   * `npm install <package-name>` – Install a package.
//   * `npm uninstall <package-name>` – Remove a package.
//   * `npm list` – View installed packages.

// ---

// ### Why NPM is Important

// * Provides access to over a million free packages.
// * Saves time and effort during development.
// * Promotes open-source software culture.
// * Allows faster project setup with ready-to-use libraries.

// ---

// ### Example

// If we want to use PostgreSQL in Node.js, we can search for “PostgreSQL” on npmjs.com and choose from several ready-made packages to connect our app with the database.

// ---

// ### Node Ecosystem

// * Node.js has one of the largest collections of free and open-source code.
// * Developers around the world contribute and improve packages.
// * This continuous contribution makes Node.js more powerful and popular.

// ---

// ### Key Points

// * Node.js allows using external packages through npm.
// * NPM acts as a central hub for package management.
// * Open-source collaboration is the foundation of Node’s growth.
// * Using npm makes development faster, easier, and more efficient.
