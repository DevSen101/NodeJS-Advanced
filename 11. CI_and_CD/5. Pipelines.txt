## 🧩 **CI/CD Pipeline**

### **Definition**

A **CI/CD pipeline** is a sequence of automated steps that take your code from **development to production**.
It includes everything from **building, testing, and deploying** your application automatically whenever new code is pushed.

---

### **Explanation**

* Whenever a developer pushes code to a repository (like GitHub), the **CI/CD server** (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) starts executing a series of automated steps.
* These steps are collectively known as the **pipeline**.

The pipeline may include:

1. **Build Step:**
   The CI server compiles or builds the project.
   Example — compiling a Java project or building a Docker image.

2. **Test Step:**
   Automated tests run to check that the new code doesn’t break existing functionality.
   There are different types of tests:

   * **Smoke tests:** Basic checks to catch obvious issues.
   * **Unit tests:** Test small modules or functions individually.
   * **Integration tests:** Ensure different parts of the application work well together.

3. **Deploy Step:**
   If all tests pass, the pipeline may automatically deploy the code.
   This could be to a **staging environment** (for testing) or **production environment** (for users).

### **Example**

Imagine a **food delivery app**:

1. A developer adds a new feature — “Track order in real time” — and pushes it to GitHub.
2. The CI/CD pipeline starts automatically:

   * **Builds** the app.
   * **Runs unit and integration tests.**
   * **Builds a Docker container** for deployment.
   * **Deploys the app** to the staging server for final testing.
3. After review, the code is automatically **deployed to production**, and users instantly see the new feature.

### **Staging vs Production**

* **Staging Environment:**
  A pre-production environment that mimics production. Used to test before public release.
* **Production Environment:**
  The live environment used by actual users.

Some teams do:

* Continuous Deployment → **staging only** (manual release to production).
* Others do → Continuous Deployment → **directly to production.**

---

### **Benefits**

1. Faster delivery of features and bug fixes.
2. Early detection of issues through automated testing.
3. Consistent, repeatable deployment process.
4. Reduced human error and manual work.
5. Easier collaboration among developers.

### **In Short**

> The CI/CD pipeline automates **building, testing, and deploying** applications — ensuring faster, safer, and more reliable software releases.
