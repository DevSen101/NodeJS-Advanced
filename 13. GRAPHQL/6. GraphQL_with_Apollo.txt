## 🔷 What Is Apollo?

Apollo is a **GraphQL platform** — a full ecosystem of tools to build, query, and manage GraphQL APIs.
It provides both **client** and **server** libraries that go beyond the basic `express-graphql` setup.

---

### ⚙️ Apollo Client

* Used on the **frontend** (React, Angular, iOS, Android).
* Makes GraphQL queries directly to your backend.
* Handles:

  * Caching of query results
  * Loading and error states
  * Auto data synchronization with the server
  * Reactive updates in components
* It replaces manually making `POST` requests to `/graphql`.

✅ **Main Benefit:** It automatically connects your frontend UI with your GraphQL data.

### 🖥️ Apollo Server

* A **backend library** to build a GraphQL API in Node.js.
* Works similarly to `express-graphql` but includes extra features:

  * Middleware support for Express, Koa, Fastify, etc.
  * Integration with **serverless** platforms (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions).
  * Built-in support for **subscriptions** (real-time updates via WebSocket).
* It can replace `express-graphql` directly, or integrate into an existing Express app.

### 🧩 GraphQL Operations Recap

1. **Query** → Read data
2. **Mutation** → Write/update data
3. **Subscription** → Real-time updates (e.g., push notifications)

Apollo makes all three easier to implement.

---

### 🚀 Extra Features

* “Batteries included” packages for full setup (`apollo-server`).
* Specialized versions like:

  * `apollo-server-express`
  * `apollo-server-lambda`
  * `apollo-server-fastify`
* Well-documented official site with full guides.

### 💡 Key Takeaway

> Apollo is a **feature-rich GraphQL framework** that simplifies both client and server development.
> For the backend, it’s like `express-graphql` but with more power — including caching, subscriptions, and integrations for modern deployments.
