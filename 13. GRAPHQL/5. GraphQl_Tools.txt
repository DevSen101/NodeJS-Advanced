## 📘 GraphQL Tools – Summary

### 🔹 Why It’s Needed

* As projects grow, **GraphQL schemas and resolvers** become too big to manage in one file.
* We need a way to:

  * Split schemas into multiple files (by feature).
  * Organize code by **functionality** instead of keeping everything in one place.
  * Manage **complex business logic** cleanly.

### 🔹 What Is GraphQL Tools?

* **A set of utilities** made by the Apollo team.
* Helps you easily:

  1. Split schemas into multiple `.graphql` files.
  2. Merge them back into one executable schema.
  3. Keep resolvers separate from schema definitions.
  4. Organize your GraphQL server into **modular, maintainable parts**.

### 🔹 Connection to Apollo

* GraphQL Tools is used **inside Apollo Server**, but it’s **standalone**.
* You can use it even if you’re working with plain `express-graphql`.
* It’s **open source** and widely used (by companies like Microsoft and PayPal).

---

### 🔹 Benefits

✅ Cleaner folder structure (schemas, resolvers, models separated)
✅ Easier to maintain and scale
✅ Proven, production-ready
✅ Compatible with both **Apollo Server** and **express-graphql**

### ⚠️ Note on Apollo Services

* Apollo offers paid GraphQL cloud services.
* Most of Apollo’s core libraries are free and open source.
* You can use GraphQL Tools without relying on Apollo’s paid products.

### 💡 Key Takeaway

> **GraphQL Tools** helps you split, organize, and merge schemas and resolvers — bringing professional structure to large GraphQL projects, whether you use Express or Apollo.
