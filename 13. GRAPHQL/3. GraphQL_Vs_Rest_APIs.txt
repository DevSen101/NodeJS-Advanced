### GraphQL vs REST – Why GraphQL Is Better

#### Overview

* GraphQL solves key problems faced by REST APIs.
* Instead of multiple endpoints, GraphQL uses **one single endpoint** to fetch all required data.
* It removes two common issues: **over-fetching** and **under-fetching**.

---

### Over-fetching and Under-fetching

* **Over-fetching** → getting more data than needed.
  Example: you just need the number of cart items, but REST returns full product details.
* **Under-fetching** → needing to make multiple requests to get all required data.
  Example: product details, reviews, and cart summary require three separate requests.

### Example: E-commerce Application (REST Approach)

* Building an online store like Amazon involves multiple endpoints:

  * `/products` → list or search products
  * `/products/:id` → product details
  * `/reviews/:productId` → product reviews
  * `/cart` → get, add, or remove items
  * `/orders` → create or view orders
* To show one product page (e.g., shoes):

  * Request product details
  * Request reviews
  * Request cart summary
* → That’s **three server trips**, slowing load time and wasting bandwidth.
* Each request may also contain unneeded data (over-fetching).

---

### How GraphQL Solves This

* GraphQL allows a **single request** to ask for exactly the needed data.
* The client sends a query describing all data requirements.
* The GraphQL server collects all required information through **resolvers** (functions) and returns a single, shaped response.
* No redundant data → no over-fetching.
* No multiple requests → no under-fetching.

---

### Benefits

* **Faster** page loads — fewer round trips.
* **Efficient** bandwidth usage — only necessary fields returned.
* **Simpler frontend logic** — one endpoint for all data needs.
* **Flexible** — frontend controls what data it gets, independent of backend structure.

---

### Trade-offs

* GraphQL introduces extra **complexity** in setup and query handling.
* For small apps, REST may be simpler.
* For large applications with many data relationships, GraphQL provides major performance and flexibility advantages.

### Key Point

> Frontend developers care about data, not endpoints.
> GraphQL lets them request **only what’s needed** — nothing more, nothing less.
