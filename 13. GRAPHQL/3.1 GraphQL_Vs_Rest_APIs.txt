# 📘 GraphQL vs REST — Summary Notes

## 🔹 REST API Overview

* **Stateless:** Easy to scale and cluster servers.
* **Named Endpoints:** Each resource has its own URL (like `/users`, `/products`).
* **HTTP-based:** Closely follows standard web protocols.
* **Easy Caching:** Responses are predictable (same URL → same response).

---

## 🔹 GraphQL Overview

* **Single Endpoint:** All data comes from one endpoint (e.g., `/graphql`).
* **Flexible Queries:** Client requests exactly what it needs → no over-fetching or under-fetching.
* **Schemas and Types:**

  * *Schemas* describe available data and structure.
  * *Types* ensure data validity (e.g., `String`, `Int`).
* **Database-Like Querying:** Frontend can query backend like a database.
* **Faster Development:** Frontend teams don’t wait for new backend endpoints — just update queries.

## 🔹 Example: Star Wars API Tool

GraphQL provides an interactive **GraphiQL tool** (or Apollo Sandbox) for testing queries.
You can explore data like:

```graphql
{
  allStarships {
    name
    model
  }
}
```

Each object (e.g., Starship, Droid, Friends) has a unique `id`, which helps in **caching and referencing**.

## 🔹 Advantages of GraphQL

1. **Single Request:** Fetch multiple related data in one query.
2. **No Over/Under Fetching:** Get only required fields.
3. **Strongly Typed Schema:** Predictable data structure.
4. **Faster Development:** Less waiting between frontend and backend teams.
5. **Active Community:** Tools like Apollo, GraphiQL, Relay, etc.

---

## 🔹 Disadvantages of GraphQL

1. **Complexity:** Developers must learn GraphQL syntax and schema setup.
2. **Difficult Caching:** Since URLs don’t define responses, caching requires inspecting queries or IDs.
3. **Initial Setup Time:** Defining schemas/types can be time-consuming for small apps.
4. **Not RESTful:** Many existing tools/libraries built for REST don’t directly support GraphQL.

## 🔹 REST + GraphQL Together

* They can **coexist** in the same project.
* Common pattern:

  * Use **REST** for simple operations like authentication or file uploads.
  * Use **GraphQL** for flexible, complex data queries.
* Migration can be done **gradually** — add GraphQL endpoint while keeping REST routes.
