### GraphQL Basics – Writing Your First Query

* **GraphQL** is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need and nothing more.
* It solves over-fetching and under-fetching problems common in REST APIs.

---

### Structure of a Query

* A **GraphQL query** has a predictable structure:

  ```graphql
  {
    typeName {
      field1
      field2
    }
  }
  ```
* You specify which **type** you want to fetch (for example, `books`) and which **fields** you want (for example, `title`, `author`).

---

### Example Query

```graphql
{
  books {
    title
    author
  }
}
```

* This query asks for all books and only returns the title and author fields.
* The response will look like the query shape:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "books": [
      {
        "title": "Clean Code",
        "author": "Robert C. Martin"
      },
      {
        "title": "The Pragmatic Programmer",
        "author": "Andrew Hunt"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

### Fetching Multiple Data Types

* You can request multiple data types in the same query:

  ```graphql
  {
    books {
      title
      author
    }
    authors {
      name
      nationality
    }
  }
  ```
* The server will return both datasets in one round trip.

You can try GraphQL queries using online tools such as the Star Wars GraphQL API (based on SWAPI).

### Key Points

* Every GraphQL query must begin with `{}` to represent the root.
* The fields you select determine what data is returned — no extra data is sent.
* GraphQL responses mirror the structure of the query.
* You can explore and test queries using tools like **GraphiQL** or **Apollo Sandbox**.
* Each field in a GraphQL query corresponds to a function (resolver) on the server.
