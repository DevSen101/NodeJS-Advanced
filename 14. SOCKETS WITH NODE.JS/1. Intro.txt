### 🔹 Topic: Introduction to **Sockets**

* Sockets are **fundamental to the internet**.
* Used in apps like **Discord** or **WhatsApp** for real-time communication.
* With normal HTTP:

  * **POST** → send a message.
  * **GET** → fetch messages.
* Problem:

  * How do we know **when** to fetch new messages?
  * People can reply **anytime** — seconds, hours, or days later.
* Regular requests can’t handle **real-time updates** efficiently.
* This is where **Sockets** come in — they enable **continuous, two-way communication** between client and server.
* Before learning sockets, we explore **how traditional HTTP** would handle this and its limitations.

This transcript explains **polling** — one of the simplest ways to keep client data up to date with the server — and why it’s often replaced by **web sockets** for real-time applications.

Here’s a **summary with key points**:

### 🧠 Concept: Polling

* **Definition:** The client repeatedly sends `GET` requests to the server at fixed time intervals to check for new data.
* **Example use case:** Chat applications where new messages can arrive at any time.

---

### 💻 Implementation Example (Client Side)

```js
const pollingRate = 500; // 500 milliseconds

setInterval(() => {
  fetch('https://api.mychatapp.com/messages') // imaginary endpoint
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      // Update messages in UI
      console.log(data);
    });
}, pollingRate);
```

* This makes a request every 500 ms.
* Each request fetches new messages.
* The new data is then displayed in the app.

### ⚠️ Problems with Polling

1. **Choosing the right interval:**

   * Too short → high server load.
   * Too long → poor real-time experience.

2. **Latency:**

   * A 500 ms delay means users always see data that’s up to half a second old.

3. **Scalability:**

   * 120 requests per minute per user (2 requests/sec).
   * Many users → large server cost and bandwidth usage.

4. **Not suitable for real-time critical apps:**

   * Examples: self-driving cars, stock trading, or multiplayer games (like Pong).
   * Even a small delay can cause major problems.

---

### 🚀 Transition

* Polling works but is inefficient for real-time updates.
* The lecture ends by hinting at the better solution: **Sockets (WebSockets)**, which allow **continuous, two-way communication** between client and server without constant HTTP requests.
