PostgreSQL for Amazon Orders

1. Problem with Spreadsheets
- Jeff Bezos initially tracks orders with pen, paper, then Excel.
- As Amazon grows, spreadsheets become hard to manage: duplicates, moved customers, changing addresses.

2. Solution: Database
- Install a Database Management System (DBMS) like PostgreSQL.
- Allows storing, manipulating, and organizing data efficiently.

3. Creating Tables
- Customers Table:
  - Each customer has a unique ID.
  - Keeps track of names, addresses, and contact info.
  - One record per customer → easy to update address.
- Products Table:
  - Each product has a unique ID.
  - Includes description, price, stock, etc.
  - One place to update product info.
- Orders Table:
  - Each order has a unique ID.
  - References Customer ID and Product ID.
  - Includes quantity, price, shipping info.

4. Relations Between Tables
- Customer ID links Orders → Customers.
- Product ID links Orders → Products.
- Updating info in one place updates all related records.

5. Advantages of Relational Database
- Handles large amounts of data efficiently.
- Reduces errors from duplicate or outdated info.
- Structured for easy querying using SQL.
- More intuitive than Excel for complex systems.

6. Next Steps
- Explore the playground to see how tables are organized.
- Practice linking data and understanding orders through SQL queries.
