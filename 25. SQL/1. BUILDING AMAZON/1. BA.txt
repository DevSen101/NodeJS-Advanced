# Understanding Amazon's Use of Databases

1. Introduction
- Exercise goal: Understand how Amazon uses databases.
- Scenario: Back in the 1990s when Amazon just started.

2. Early Order Tracking
- Initial method: Notebook and pen.
  - Example: Joe orders a Harry Potter book.
  - Jeff records customer name, address, and payment info manually.
- Problem: Manual tracking becomes overwhelming as orders increase.

3. Using Spreadsheets
- Next step: Jeff uses Excel to track orders.
- Benefits: Cleaner and more organized than pen and paper.
- Example Orders:
  - Andre orders a toy duck (quantity: 2)
  - Moe buys 100 candies
  - Bruno buys hair gel
  - Sally buys a Harry Potter book
- Issue: Multiple orders, returns, and address changes make spreadsheets confusing.
  - Example: Andre orders glasses, returns them, moves to Japan, orders again.
- Limitation: Spreadsheet rows increase, making management harder.

4. Need for Databases
- Problem: Spreadsheets cannot efficiently handle growing data and complex operations.
- Solution: Use a database system to manage data more efficiently.

5. Interactive Database Playground
- Online interactive platform introduced for practice.
- Database structure:
  - Tables for customers, orders, products, categories.
  - Example data:
    - 91 customers
    - 8 categories
  - Each table has columns for relevant information (IDs, names, addresses, etc.)
- Querying:
  - Use SQL statements to retrieve and manipulate data.
  - Example: `SELECT * FROM customers;`
- Benefits over spreadsheets:
  - Organized in tables.
  - Can handle large amounts of data.
  - Can perform queries to get exactly what is needed.

6. Practice Task
- Users are encouraged to explore the playground:
  - Click categories.
  - Run SQL statements.
  - Observe how data is structured and retrieved.
- Goal: Understand differences between spreadsheet-based tracking and database systems.

7. Key Takeaways
- Spreadsheets are good for small-scale data but not scalable.
- Databases allow efficient storage, retrieval, and management of large and complex datasets.
- SQL is used to interact with database tables.
- This sets the stage for understanding Amazonâ€™s scalable database system.
