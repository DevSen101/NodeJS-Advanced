TOPIC: COLUMNS IN THE RELATIONAL MODEL

1. **Definition**
   - A table is made up of **columns** and **rows**.
   - Each **column** represents a specific type of data (e.g., last name, date of birth).
   - Each column has a **name** and a **data type**.

2. **Degree of a Relation**
   - The **collection of all columns** in a table is called the **degree of the relation**.
   - Example: If a table has columns – ID, First Name, Last Name, Sex, Date of Birth –  
     → the **degree** of this relation = 5.

3. **Domain / Constraint**
   - Each column stores a **specific type of data**, defined by its **domain**.
   - **Domain** = The set of allowed values for that column.
   - Also known as a **constraint**, since it restricts what can be stored.

   Examples:
   - `DateOfBirth` → Only valid date values allowed.
   - `Sex` → Only ‘M’, ‘F’, or other defined letters allowed.
   - `ID` → Only numbers allowed.

4. **Terminology Equivalence**
   - **Column** = **Attribute**
   - **Collection of Columns** = **Degree of the Relation**
   - **Constraint / Domain** = The **allowed type of data** for a column.

   So, one can say:
   - “The table has these attributes.”
   - “The relation has a degree of 5.”
   - “This column has a domain of dates.”

5. **Importance of Domains/Constraints**
   - Ensures **data consistency and accuracy**.
   - Prevents insertion of invalid or unexpected data.
   - Makes the database **structured and reliable**.

6. **Summary**
   - Every **table** has one or more **columns**.
   - Each column:
     - Has a **name**.
     - Has a **data type / domain**.
     - Represents a **specific attribute** of the data.
   - The collection of columns defines the **degree** of the table.
   - **Constraints (Domains)** restrict what kind of data can be stored.

→ Example:
| ID | FirstName | LastName | Sex | DateOfBirth |
|----|------------|-----------|-----|-------------|
| 1  | Dev        | Sen       | M   | 1999-08-10  |

- Degree = 5  
- Domains:
  - ID → Integer  
  - FirstName, LastName → Text  
  - Sex → Char(1)  
  - DateOfBirth → Date
