SQL Queries

1. What is a Query?
- A query is an instruction written in English-like syntax to get data from a database.
- Synonyms: SQL statement = query.
- Queries are how we ask questions to the database to get answers.

2. Basic SQL Query
- Example: `SELECT * FROM users;`
  - `SELECT`: keyword to retrieve data.
  - `*`: wildcard to get all fields.
  - `FROM users`: specifies the table (users) to get data from.
- Output: all user information (ID, name, last name, date of birth, etc.).

3. Filtering Data
- Use `WHERE` to filter results.
- Example: `SELECT name FROM users WHERE role = 'manager';`
  - `name`: identifier (specific column to retrieve).
  - `role = 'manager'`: condition to filter data.
  - `manager`: expression, the value we want to match.

4. SQL Clauses
- `SELECT` clause: specifies which columns to return.
- `FROM` clause: specifies the table.
- `WHERE` clause: defines conditions to filter data.
- Each clause is a part of the SQL statement.

5. Comments in SQL
- Use comments to disable lines temporarily.
- Example: `-- This is a comment`.

6. Declarative Language
- SQL is a declarative language: you describe *what* you want, not *how* to get it.
- Example: `SELECT name FROM users WHERE role = 'manager';` asks a question, database decides how to retrieve the data.
