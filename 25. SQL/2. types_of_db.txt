Types of Databases

1. Overview
- Hundreds of database management systems (DBMS) exist.
- Most developers only use a few (2-5) throughout their career.
- Databases can be categorized into five main types (data models).

2. Relational Databases
- Examples: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server.
- Uses tables with rows and columns.
- Supports ACID transactions.
- Ideal for e-commerce, business applications, customer data.
- Strong integration with SQL.

3. Document Databases
- Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB, Firebase.
- Data stored as documents (like JSON objects), not tables.
- Good for scalability and large datasets.
- Often used in web apps with complex, nested data.

4. Key-Value Databases
- Examples: Redis, DynamoDB, etc.
- Stores data as key-value pairs.
- Simple and fast for retrieval by key.
- Useful for caching and high-performance operations.

5. Graph Databases
- Examples: Neo4j, AWS Neptune.
- Focused on relationships between entities.
- Useful for social networks, recommendation systems.
- Less common due to complexity.

6. Wide Column Databases
- Examples: Google Bigtable, Apache Cassandra.
- Stores data in columns rather than rows.
- Optimized for large-scale, distributed storage.
- Useful for analytics and big data applications.

7. Summary
- Start with relational and document databases.
- Key-value, graph, and wide column are specialized models.
- Understanding differences helps choose the right DB for the use case.
