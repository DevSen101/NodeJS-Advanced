SQL Standards and Standardization
----------------------------------

1. Introduction
- SQL is the language used to communicate with databases.
- Many companies (Microsoft, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) build database systems.
- All these companies use SQL, but it must stay consistent across implementations.

2. What is Standardization?
- SQL is a standardized language — meaning it follows a set of defined rules.
- A committee comes together to decide and update these rules.
- They define what SQL should support and how it should behave.
- This ensures compatibility and consistency across different database systems.

3. Why Companies Follow Standards
- SQL is widely adopted — everyone in the industry understands it.
- Following standards allows:
  - Consistent behavior across systems.
  - Easier learning and usage for developers.
  - Better compatibility for tools and software.
- Companies follow the standard but add extra features to stand out (to attract more users).

4. Example
- Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL all follow the SQL standard.
- However, each adds unique extensions and optimizations.
- Despite small differences, the core language remains the same.

5. History of SQL Standards
- First SQL standard: released in the **1980s**.
- Updated versions followed in:
  - 1989
  - 1992
  - 1999
  - 2003
  - 2008
  - 201
