SQL Overview

1. What is SQL?
- SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to communicate with databases.
- It's a programming language designed to request, insert, update, and manage data.
- Provides instructions to get specific outputs (data) from databases.

2. Understanding Databases
- A database is a structured set of data.
- Structure determines how data is stored and accessed.
- Examples of structures:
  - Notepad: custom headings and paragraphs.
  - Excel: rows and columns.
- Large companies like Amazon or Microsoft require robust databases, not flat files or spreadsheets.

3. Database Models
- Different models define how data is stored and organized.
- This course will cover multiple models but mainly focus on one key model.

4. SQL Usage
- SQL statements are instructions given to the database.
- Statements are called queries.
- Queries are used to:
  - Pull data
  - Insert data
  - Update data
  - Manage database operations
