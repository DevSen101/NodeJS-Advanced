History of SQL
---------------

1. Introduction
- We already know what SQL and queries are, and why SQL is declarative.
- Now we look at the history of SQL — how it started and evolved.

2. Origin
- The original name of SQL was SEQUEL.
- SEQUEL stood for "Structured English Query Language".
- Due to copyright issues, the name was shortened to SQL (Structured Query Language).
- Both names (SQL and SEQUEL) are still used interchangeably.

3. Timeline
- SQL was developed in the **early 1980s**.
- It became the **standard language** for storing and manipulating data.
- The foundation was laid in the **1970s** by IBM researchers.

4. Key Contributors
- **Edgar F. Codd (IBM)** wrote a paper in the 1970s titled:
  "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks".
- His paper introduced the **relational model**, which inspired SQL.
- Two IBM developers, **Donald Chamberlin** and **Raymond Boyce**, implemented Codd’s vision.
- They created the **first version of SQL** — both the language and database software.

5. Importance
- SQL became the standard for **managing and manipulating databases**.
- The relational model and SQL revolutionized data storage and access.
- These IBM researchers laid the foundation for all modern relational databases.

6. Summary
- SQL = Structured Query Language (formerly SEQUEL).
- Invented at IBM in the 1970s → standardized in the 1980s.
- Based on Codd’s relational model.
- Created by Chamberlin and Boyce.
- Remains the standard language for relational databases today.
