Postman and API Testing Notes:

1. Browsers can test APIs using fetch, but Postman is a better tool.

2. Postman:
   - Collaborative API testing tool.
   - Allows creation of HTTP requests, organizing them into collections, and sharing with teammates.
   - Integrates with REST, SOAP, and GraphQL.
   - Supports automated testing to check API stability in production.
   - Design and mock functionality: develop frontend even if backend isn't ready.
   - Documentation: generates API docs from requests and responses.
   - Monitoring: checks API health and uptime.
   - Workspaces: share requests with team for collaboration.

3. Insomnia:
   - Another API testing tool.
   - Simpler UI, but fewer features compared to Postman.
   - Both tools are effective.

4. Using Postman:
   - Create a collection, e.g., "Express Example".
   - Add requests, e.g., "Get Friends".
   - Set endpoint URL, e.g., localhost:3000/friends.
   - Send request to backend.
   - Postman shows response (JSON, XML, HTML, text).

5. POST requests:
   - Set body type (usually raw for JSON).
   - Select application/json as content type.
   - Can inspect response headers.

6. Response info:
   - Shows headers like X-Powered-By and Content-Type.
   - Status code (e.g., 200).
   - Response time and data size.

7. Postman supports all HTTP methods:
   - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and uncommon methods.

8. Insomnia usage:
   - Similar workflow: create folder, add request, set endpoint URL.
   - Response and headers visible, similar to Postman.

9. Summary:
   - Both Postman and Insomnia are excellent for API testing.
   - Postman is more fully featured, Insomnia simpler to use.
