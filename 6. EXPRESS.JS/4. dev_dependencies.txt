Nodemon and Development Dependencies Notes:

1. Restarting the server manually after every change is tiresome.

2. Nodemon:
   - Tool to automatically restart the server when JavaScript files change.
   - Install with npm: `npm install nodemon --save-dev`
   - `--save-dev` flag adds Nodemon to the devDependencies section in package.json.

3. DevDependencies:
   - Only needed during development.
   - Not required to run the project in production.
   - Examples: Nodemon, testing tools, build tools.
   - Helps keep the project lightweight for production and open-source sharing.
   - Keeps node_modules organized and prevents unnecessary growth.

4. Usage:
   - Add a script in package.json, e.g., `"watch": "nodemon server.js"`.
   - Run with `npm run watch`.
   - Server automatically restarts on file changes, e.g., changing a friend's name.

5. Summary:
   - Nodemon improves development workflow.
   - DevDependencies separate development-only tools from production dependencies.
   - Keeps node_modules tidy and project easier to manage.
