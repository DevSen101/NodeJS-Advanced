CRUD Operations in REST APIs
----------------------------

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete — the four basic operations performed on data.

Each CRUD operation corresponds to an HTTP method:
- Create → POST
- Read → GET
- Update → PUT or PATCH
- Delete → DELETE

1. Create (POST)
   - Used to add new data to a collection.
   - Example: POST /customers → creates a new customer.
   - Response code: 201 (Created).

2. Read (GET)
   - Used to retrieve data.
   - Example: GET /customers → returns all customers.
   - Example: GET /customers/:id → returns one customer.

3. Update (PUT or PATCH)
   - PUT replaces an entire existing resource with new data.
   - PATCH modifies only specific fields of a resource.
   - Example: PUT /customers/:id → replace the whole object.
   - Example: PATCH /customers/:id → update only some properties.

4. Delete (DELETE)
   - Used to remove data.
   - Example: DELETE /customers/:id → deletes a specific customer.
   - Example: DELETE /customers → deletes the entire collection (rare).

Collection vs. Item
- Operations can apply to an entire collection (e.g., /customers)
  or a single item using its ID (e.g., /customers/:id).

HTTP Status Codes
- 200 OK → Successful request.
- 201 Created → Resource created.
- 404 Not Found → Resource or endpoint not found.
- 405 Method Not Allowed → Method not valid for endpoint.

Key Points
- CRUD maps directly to HTTP methods.
- Use correct status codes for clarity.
- Usually work with one item at a time, not the whole collection.
- PUT replaces; PATCH modifies specific fields.

In short:
CRUD → HTTP → RESTful API foundation.
