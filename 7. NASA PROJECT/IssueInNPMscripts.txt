the npm run watch command may not start both your client and server, depending on your shell. To solve this:
You can use an NPM package like concurrently or npm-run-all instead of the & symbol in the npm run watch command.

Or if you have the bash shell installed on your machine (for example, through Git for Windows), set the default shell used by NPM to the bash shell by typing: npm config set script-shell bash in your terminal. All commands in your package.json will now run in a bash shell.



If you're having issues with the npm install command:

Try removing package-lock.json in both the server/ and client/ folders.

Try updating to a version of Node greater than 16 with an NPM version greater than 7.11. There is a bug in previous versions of NPM that prevents the --prefix parameter from working correctly.



What we're working with here is automation and specifically DevOps, which is often a dedicated role when working in a larger team of developers. It takes lots of practice and patience to get right!
