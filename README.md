# 🚀 NodeJS-Advanced

This repository is a **complete learning log and implementation journey** of my Node.js mastery — covering everything from **core fundamentals** to **advanced real-world projects**.

With **100+ commits**, each commit documents a step in my learning — from understanding Node.js internals to building production-ready applications.  
Every commit message is crafted to be clear and educational so that others can easily follow the progression and implementation ideas.

## 🧠 Introduction

This repo begins with the **core foundation of Node.js** — exploring how the runtime works, understanding the V8 engine, event loop, asynchronous behavior, and the module system.  
From there, it gradually transitions into advanced concepts, frameworks, and full-scale projects.
