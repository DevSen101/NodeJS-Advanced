// We cant write all of the code for our final product from scratch for example if i want to make a http web server so i'll try to focus on features of my server instead of writing http code or how http work so for that JS(not vanilla) provides us a built in function require() which takes the js file execute it and return the code and we can use that by asigning ina variable

// for ex.

// const httpServer = require('http')
