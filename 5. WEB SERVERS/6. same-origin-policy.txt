Same Origin Policy - Simple Notes

1. Meaning:
The Same Origin Policy (SOP) is a browser security feature that limits how web pages from one origin can interact with resources from another origin.

2. What is an Origin:
An origin is made up of three parts:
- Protocol (http or https)
- Host (domain name, like google.com)
- Port (example: 80 for http, 443 for https)

3. When Origin Changes:
If any one of these three parts changes (protocol, host, or port), it becomes a different origin.
Example:
- https://www.google.com/maps and https://www.google.com/mail → same origin
- http://www.google.com and https://www.google.com → different origin
- https://google.com and https://facebook.com → different origin

4. Why SOP Exists:
SOP is used to protect users from malicious websites trying to access or steal data from other sites.

5. How SOP Works:
Your browser only allows scripts from the same origin to make requests to the same origin server.
Requests from one origin (like google.com) to another (like facebook.com) are blocked by default.

6. Exception - Form Submission:
Some cross-origin actions like submitting a form (POST request) are allowed because the target server decides how to handle them.

7. Example:
If you’re on google.com, you can click a link to go to wikipedia.org (browser navigation allowed),
but JavaScript on google.com cannot fetch data directly from wikipedia.org (blocked by SOP).

8. Cross-Origin Requests:
When JavaScript tries to fetch data from another origin, the browser blocks it and shows an error like:
“Access to fetch has been blocked by CORS policy: No Access-Control-Allow-Origin header present.”

9. What is CORS:
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows a server to specify which origins are allowed to access its resources safely.

10. Main Idea:
The Same Origin Policy protects users by preventing malicious sites from accessing private data on other sites,
while still allowing safe actions like navigation and server-controlled communication.
