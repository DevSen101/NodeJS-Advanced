Node.js – Understanding APIs and HTTP Methods
============================================================

### Introduction
- When we browse to a website, the system uses DNS to find where that site lives.
- DNS gives the IP address of the server so the browser can communicate with it.
- We make requests to the HTTP web server to get data back.

------------------------------------------------------------
### What Defines the Server's Behavior?
------------------------------------------------------------
- The thing that defines how a web server responds to requests is called the **API**.
- The **API (Application Programming Interface)** tells:
  - What functions the server should support.
  - How those functions should be used.

Examples:
- Get a list of friends.
- Get messages or photos.
- Post or upload a new photo.
- Delete user data.

------------------------------------------------------------
### APIs and Programming Languages
------------------------------------------------------------
- APIs can be implemented in any language (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.).
- The key point is that communication happens using **HTTP**.
- HTTP is the shared "language" between browsers and servers.
- The browser speaks HTTP to send requests.
- The server speaks HTTP to send responses.

------------------------------------------------------------
### The HTTP Language
------------------------------------------------------------
- HTTP defines a set of **request methods**, also called **HTTP verbs**.
- These verbs describe what action the client wants the server to perform.

Common HTTP Methods:
1. **GET** – Retrieve data from the server.
2. **POST** – Send or submit data to the server (e.g., form submission, file upload).
3. **DELETE** – Remove existing data on the server.
4. **PUT** – Replace existing data with new data.
5. **PATC**
